## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)** and **Power Dissipation** of a CMOS inverter using **LTspice**. The CMOS inverter is a fundamental building block in digital circuits, and understanding its behavior is crucial for designing energy-efficient and high-performance systems. The project involves:
1. Simulating the VTC curve to study the input-output relationship.
2. Analyzing static and dynamic power dissipation.
3. Using Level 3 SPICE models for NMOS and PMOS transistors.

## Project Description
The CMOS inverter consists of an NMOS and a PMOS transistor. The project aims to:
- **Simulate the VTC curve**: Analyze the relationship between input voltage (\(V_{in}\)) and output voltage (\(V_{out}\)).
- **Measure power dissipation**: Evaluate static and dynamic power consumption.
- **Optimize performance**: Study the impact of transistor parameters on circuit behavior.

The project uses **LTspice**, a powerful SPICE-based circuit simulator, to perform DC and transient analyses.

## Circuit Design
The CMOS inverter circuit is designed using the following components:
- **NMOS Transistor**: Level 3 SPICE model with parameters such as \(V_{th,n}\), \(KP_n\), and \(\lambda_n\).
- **PMOS Transistor**: Level 3 SPICE model with parameters such as \(V_{th,p}\), \(KP_p\), and \(\lambda_p\).
- **Power Supply (\(V_{DD}\))**: Typically set to 5V.
- **Load Capacitance (\(C_L\))**: Represents the output load.

## Simulation Setup
### Steps to Run the Simulation
1. **Install LTspice**: Download and install LTspice from [Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html).
2. **Create the Circuit**:
   - Open LTspice and create a new schematic.
   - Add NMOS and PMOS transistors using the provided SPICE models.
   - Connect the transistors to form a CMOS inverter.
   - Set up a DC voltage source for \(V_{DD}\) and a pulse source for \(V_{in}\).
3. **Run Simulations**:
   - **DC Analysis**: Sweep \(V_{in}\) from 0V to \(V_{DD}\) to obtain the VTC curve.
   - **Transient Analysis**: Apply a square wave input to measure power dissipation.
4. **Analyze Results**:
   - Plot \(V_{out}\) vs. \(V_{in}\) for the VTC curve.
   - Measure average power dissipation using LTspice's power measurement tools.

## Results
### Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)
The VTC curve shows the relationship between \(V_{in}\) and \(V_{out}\). Key observations include:
- **Transition Region**: The region where both NMOS and PMOS transistors are partially ON.
- **Noise Margins**: \(NM_L\) and \(NM_H\) are calculated from the VTC curve.

### Power Dissipation
- **Static Power**: Measured when the input is stable (either HIGH or LOW).
- **Dynamic Power**: Measured during switching, including switching power and short-circuit power.
