## Introduction
A CMOS inverter is a fundamental building block in digital circuits, consisting of an NMOS and a PMOS transistor. The Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) of a CMOS inverter describes the relationship between the input voltage (
V
i
n
V 
in
​
 ) and the output voltage (
V
o
u
t
V 
out
​
 ). Power dissipation in a CMOS inverter is a critical metric, as it determines the energy efficiency of the circuit. This project involves analyzing the VTC and power dissipation of a CMOS inverter using LTspice, with the given NMOS and PMOS model parameters.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need the following software to run the simulations:
- [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/7supriyo/Analysis-of-Voltage-Transfer-Characteristic-and-Power-Dissipation-in-a-CMOS-Inverter-using-LTspice.git
   ```
2. Open the LTspice software.

### Usage
1. Open the cloned repository in LTspice.
2. Run the simulation files provided in the repository to generate the VTC and power dissipation plots.
3. Adjust the parameters in the LTspice files to observe different behaviors of the CMOS inverter.
### 1. **CMOS Inverter Operation**
The CMOS inverter has two operating regions:
1. **Static Operation**: When the input is stable (either HIGH or LOW), one transistor is ON, and the other is OFF.
2. **Dynamic Operation**: During switching, both transistors are partially ON, leading to short-circuit current and power dissipation.

The VTC curve is divided into five regions:
1. **Region 1**: \(V_{in} < V_{th,n}\) (NMOS OFF, PMOS ON)
2. **Region 2**: \(V_{th,n} < V_{in} < V_{M}\) (NMOS in saturation, PMOS in linear)
3. **Region 3**: \(V_{in} = V_{M}\) (Both transistors in saturation)
4. **Region 4**: \(V_{M} < V_{in} < V_{DD} - |V_{th,p}|\) (NMOS in linear, PMOS in saturation)
5. **Region 5**: \(V_{in} > V_{DD} - |V_{th,p}|\) (NMOS ON, PMOS OFF)

Where:
- \(V_{th,n}\): Threshold voltage of NMOS
- \(V_{th,p}\): Threshold voltage of PMOS
- \(V_{M}\): Midpoint voltage where \(V_{in} = V_{out}\)

### 2. **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)**
The VTC is derived by equating the currents through the NMOS and PMOS transistors. The current equations for NMOS and PMOS are based on the Level 3 MOSFET model.

#### NMOS Current Equations:
- **Linear Region**:
  \[
  I_{D,n} = KP_n \left( \frac{W}{L} \right)_n \left[ (V_{GS,n} - V_{th,n}) V_{DS,n} - \frac{V_{DS,n}^2}{2} \right] (1 + \lambda_n V_{DS,n})
  \]
- **Saturation Region**:
  \[
  I_{D,n} = \frac{KP_n}{2} \left( \frac{W}{L} \right)_n (V_{GS,n} - V_{th,n})^2 (1 + \lambda_n V_{DS,n})
  \]

#### PMOS Current Equations:
- **Linear Region**:
  \[
  I_{D,p} = KP_p \left( \frac{W}{L} \right)_p \left[ (V_{SG,p} - |V_{th,p}|) V_{SD,p} - \frac{V_{SD,p}^2}{2} \right] (1 + \lambda_p V_{SD,p})
  \]
- **Saturation Region**:
  \[
  I_{D,p} = \frac{KP_p}{2} \left( \frac{W}{L} \right)_p (V_{SG,p} - |V_{th,p}|)^2 (1 + \lambda_p V_{SD,p})
  \]

Where:
- \(KP_n\), \(KP_p\): Transconductance parameters for NMOS and PMOS
- \(V_{GS,n}\), \(V_{SG,p}\): Gate-to-source voltages
- \(V_{DS,n}\), \(V_{SD,p}\): Drain-to-source voltages
- \(\lambda_n\), \(\lambda_p\): Channel-length modulation parameters

#### VTC Analysis:
1. For each region, equate \(I_{D,n} = I_{D,p}\).
2. Solve for \(V_{out}\) as a function of \(V_{in}\).

### 3. **Power Dissipation**
Power dissipation in a CMOS inverter consists of:
1. **Static Power Dissipation**: Leakage current when the inverter is not switching.
2. **Dynamic Power Dissipation**: Switching power due to charging/discharging of load capacitance and short-circuit current.

#### Static Power Dissipation:
\[
P_{static} = I_{leak} \cdot V_{DD}
\]
Where \(I_{leak}\) is the subthreshold leakage current.

#### Dynamic Power Dissipation:
1. **Switching Power**:
   \[
   P_{switching} = \alpha \cdot C_L \cdot V_{DD}^2 \cdot f
   \]
   Where:
   - \(\alpha\): Activity factor
   - \(C_L\): Load capacitance
   - \(f\): Switching frequency

2. **Short-Circuit Power**:
   \[
   P_{short} = I_{sc} \cdot V_{DD}
   \]
   Where \(I_{sc}\) is the short-circuit current during switching.

### 4. **LTspice Simulation**
#### Steps:
1. **Define NMOS and PMOS Models**:
   Use the provided model parameters for NMOS and PMOS in LTspice.
