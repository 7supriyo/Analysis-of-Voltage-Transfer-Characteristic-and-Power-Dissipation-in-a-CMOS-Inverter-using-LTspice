# Analysis of Voltage Transfer Characteristic and Power Dissipation in a CMOS Inverter using LTspice

## Description
CMOS technology forms the backbone of modern digital circuits due to its low power consumption and high noise immunity. This project aims to analyze the Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) and Power Dissipation of a CMOS inverter using LTspice, a popular circuit simulation tool.

## Introduction
In this project, we will:
- Simulate a CMOS inverter circuit using LTspice.
- Analyze the Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) curve.
- Evaluate the power dissipation characteristics of the CMOS inverter.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need the following software to run the simulations:
- [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/7supriyo/Analysis-of-Voltage-Transfer-Characteristic-and-Power-Dissipation-in-a-CMOS-Inverter-using-LTspice.git
   ```
2. Open the LTspice software.

### Usage
1. Open the cloned repository in LTspice.
2. Run the simulation files provided in the repository to generate the VTC and power dissipation plots.
3. Adjust the parameters in the LTspice files to observe different behaviors of the CMOS inverter.

## Simulation Results
The repository includes sample simulation results demonstrating:
- The Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) curve of the CMOS inverter.
- The power dissipation characteristics under different operating conditions.
